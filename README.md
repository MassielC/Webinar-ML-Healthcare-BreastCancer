# Applications of Machine Learning in Python for Modern Biomedicine

This repository contains the materials I implemented for the free introductory webinar **"Applications of Machine Learning in Python for Modern Biomedicine: Case Study"**, organized in collaboration with [LyNbiolearning](https://www.instagram.com/lynbiolearning/). Both lecture an practical sections were included.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
- **Description:** This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. Each instance describes characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image.
- **Number of Instances:** 569
- **Number of Features:** 30 (real-valued input features)
- **Feature Examples:**
  - Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
  - Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
  - Perimeter
  - Area
  - Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- **Target Variable:**
  - Malignant (cancerous)
  - Benign (non-cancerous)
- **Usage:** This dataset is commonly used for classification tasks in biomedical research and machine learning applications.
